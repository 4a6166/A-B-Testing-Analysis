# A/B Testing Analysis
A group of notebooks analyzing the results of A/B Testing on open datasets

A/B testing is important for discovering what works when trying something new without having to rely on what boils down to a guess.
To perform A/B testing, two or more versions of a product, be it a landing page or the GUI of a full application, must be presented to a large set of users so their interactions may be observed and compared across versions

Unfortunately, this makes developing novel data for A/B testing difficult, as it takes both time and a large user base to reach a reasonable number of test subjects from which one may derive a viable result.

This repository will circumvent this issue by using only open and publicly available datasets.
Analyses will be sequestered to sub-directories based on the set and my be broken out into their own repository if it makes sense in the future.
